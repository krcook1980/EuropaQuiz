##Overview - 
 Short description ... where am I found in the code and what am I used for

##Related Components - 
If I am a parent, reference and link the children
If I am a base component, what am I used in?

##Styling -
accessible classNames and any important hard coded styling a dev should be aware of

##Props -
What props do I take in, what do they control, what are the options, is it required, if passed down to children, which child gets the prop

##Functions - 
Are there any built in functions that need to be called out (like sign up and log in both have error handling on blur already included). If no functions, leave this heading and put:
This component does not have any built in functionality
